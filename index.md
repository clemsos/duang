### Methodology

* **Data** We simply don't only trust words or numbers. We believe in solid methodical ways to collect and consolidate information.
* **Fieldwork** Data is often misleading without a grounded experience. Our research method is evolved from long-term on-site engagement with our discussion topics.
* **Visualization** Maps, graphs, and networks: We use multiple visual and other sensory interfaces to offer new representations of the data our topics explore.
